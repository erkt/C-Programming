      18) Wap to design a base class called bird and derive two new classes, flying and nonflying 	from the base class. Consider the name, color and country as data members, of class bird. 	Use required member functions ?

      19) Write a C++ program to demonstrate Hybrid Inheritence.

      20) Declare a class of vehicle. Derived classes are two_wheeler, three_wheeler and 	four_wheeler . Display the properties of each type of vehicle using member functions of 	classes ?

     21) Consider a example of declaring the examination result. Design three classes: student, exam 	and result. The student class has data members such as those representing roll 	number,name etc. Create the class exam by inheriting the student class. The exam class 	adds data members representing the marks scored in six subjects. Derive the result from the 	exam class and it has its own data members such as total_marks. Write an interactive 	program to model this relationship. What type of inheritance this model belongs to ?


      22) Write a C++ program to design a base class called student with name, roll and age as its data
             members. Using inheritance create two new classes  UGStudent and PGStudent with    
             semester, fees and datepaid as their data members. Enter the data for 5 students. Find the 
             average age, semester-wise for all UG and PG students.

      23) Write a  C++ to overload a template function.
      24) Write a  C++  to exchange the values of two variables. Using template variables as a 
	function arguments in generic way ?
     
      25) Write a C++ program  define definition of member function template outside the class and  
             invoke the function  to overload + operator for performing addition of two template based   
             class objects ?

      26) Write a C++ program to define virtual destructors ?
      27) Write a C++ program to explain the nested class.
      28) Write a C++ program to explain the this pointer.

      29) Write a C++ program to accept 10 integers in an array.check all numbers in the array.when        
	 any negative number is found, throw an exception?
      30) Write a C++ program to catch multiple exceptions?
      31) Write a C++ to throw an exception in derived class?
